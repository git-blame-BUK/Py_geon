# Building Py_geon

This will be a short walkthrough of my buildprocess.

- [Flightcontroller](https://github.com/git-blame-BUK/Py_geon/blob/main/building%20Py_geon/Hardware.md#py_geons-nervous-system) is positioned upsidedown on the small platform.
- [Boardcomputer](https://github.com/git-blame-BUK/Py_geon/blob/main/building%20Py_geon/Hardware.md#py_geons-brain) is mounted on top of Py_geon with damping pads to reduce vibration.
- [Optical Flow and Proximity Sensor](https://github.com/git-blame-BUK/Py_geon/blob/main/building%20Py_geon/Hardware.md#py_geons-eyes) are mounted facing downwards, maximizing field  of view.
- [GPS](https://github.com/git-blame-BUK/Py_geon/blob/main/building%20Py_geon/Hardware.md#py_geons-map) and Telemtry Modules need to be mounted maximising distance, same goes for the wifi antenna.
