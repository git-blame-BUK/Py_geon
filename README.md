Drone project based on [Arducopter](https://ardupilot.org/copter/index.html)/Pixhwak platform. Unlimited useability sustained by the Nvidia Jetson Nano and Python's Mavlink librarys.

Author: BUK

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals
1. Stable drone platform, relateable in and outdoor's. With a Portable formfactor
3. Autonomous flying by Python (Pymavlink) scripts running on the Jetson Nano. Lidar based Object Avoidance.
4. Py_geon has to be able to start, stabilize and orient itself. Later on identifiy me and "Objects of interest".
5. Flighttimes of approx. 20 min, weight shouldnt be more then 1,5kg
6. Performing autonomous missions based on proximity sensing and computer vision.
