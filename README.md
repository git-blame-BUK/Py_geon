Author: BUK

## Goals
1. Stable drone platform, relateable in and outdoor's. With a Portable formfactor
2. Selfbuild --> configurable with Ai and Computer vision capabilties.
3. Autonomous flying by Python (Pymavlink) scripts running on the Jetson Nano. Lidar based Object Avoidance.
4. Py_geon has to be able to start, stabilize and orient itself. Later on identifiy me and "Objects of interest".
5. Flighttimes of approx. 20 min, weight shouldnt be more then 1000g.


## Hardware

Drone Frame:
- has to be caged for indoor use. Very sturdy and small (about 30 cm)
- enough space for the Jetson nano
- upgradeable in case of to much weight of the drone
